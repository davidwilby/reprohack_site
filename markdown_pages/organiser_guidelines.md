### **Create materials associated with event**: 

You will need the relevant URLs when submitting your event (although you can always edit your event with this information at a later date)

  - **Set up registration**: The hub does not have functionality for managing registrations so you will need to use [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/) or a similar platform for for that purpose. 
  - **Event Hackpad** (eg etherpad, hack.md, googledoc  for collaborative notetaking at the event (optional). We strongly recommend having an event hackpad. Not only does it provide a place for participants to take collabotative notes of their experiences (useful during feedback sessions) but it also provides a space for them to register the papers they are working on so others can see them and perhaps join forces. You can use the [hackmd.io hackpad template](hackpad_template) we provide if you wish. This hackpad also contains a **template agenda for the day**. Feel free to customise as you wish.
  - **Introductory Slides**: Use this to introduce your participants to the platform / building, run the ice breaker, remind them of good conduct during the event and introduce tips for reviewing. You can use the [hackmd.io introductory slides](intro_slides_template) we provide as a template for welcoming all participants. Customise with details of your event.

### Register Your Event!

[Register your event](event/new/) on the ReproHack Hub. This will create a page for your event and place it on the ReproHack map. 

When registering your event, the **event decription is pre-populated with some general text in markdown format** to act as a concise but informative landing page for your event. Feel free to edit and customise with any event specific details. 

Additionally, once a valid registration is supplied, a registration button linking to that page will appear on your event page.

- **To potential authors**. An event is always a good opprotunity to publicise to more authors and reach out to authors form specific domains, institutions, conference attendees or any other focus your event might have.  

- **To potential participants**. 
  
- **Make use of social media**. Twitter in particular can be a great way to advertise your event. Try to use relevant hash tags and ask your communities to spread the word. Feel free to include @ReproHack in any tweets and we'll happily retweet and signal boost!
