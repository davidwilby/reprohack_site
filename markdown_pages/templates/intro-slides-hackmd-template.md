This template can be used for slides written and hosted on HackMD during a ReproHack event. <https://hackmd.io/>

If you are new to HackMD, please see this [short guide](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/hackmd-guide) by the Turing Way or the [full HackMD Tutorial Book](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Ftutorials) and in particular, the chapter on [Making Presentation Slides with HackMD](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Fhow-to-create-slide-deck)


The most important setting to note is that to you view the sldes you need to **enable** <i class="fa fa-tv"></i> **Slide Mode** in the top right sharing <i class="fa fa-share-alt fa-18"></i> menu and hit "**Preview**" to see your slide.

    # Welcome Back

    ---

    ## ReproHack Objectives

    1. **Practical Experience in Reproducibility**

    3. **Feedback to Authors**

    5. **Think more broadly about opportunities and challenges**

    ---

    # Plan of Action

    ---

    ### Reproduce paper

    1. **Paper review and team formation**

    2. **Select and register your paper on hackpad**

    3. **Work on your paper!**
        
    4. **Re-group part-way through.**

    5. **Feedback at the end (group & authors)**

    ---

    # Tips for reviewing

    ---

    <!-- Remind participant of code of conduct and basic expectations. Bring attention to the additional considerations involved in giving feedback to authors -->
    ## Code of Conduct

    Event governed by [**ReproHack Code of Conduct**](https://reprohack.org/code-of-conduct)

    <br>

    ### Additional Considerations

    - #### Reproducibility is hard!
    - #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!



    ---

    ## Thank you Authors! :raised_hands:

    - #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
    - #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their effort and bravery. :pray: 
    - #### Constructive criticism only please!


    ---

    # Reproduce and Review

    # :mag:

    ---

    ## Selecting Papers

    - **Author comments:** paper descroption and why you should choose to reproduce.
    - **Tags:** Tools, languages & domains
    - **No. attempts:** No. times reproduction has been attempted
    - **Mean Repro Score:** Mean reproducibility score (out of 10)
        - lower == harder!


    ---

    ## Review as an auditor :bookmark_tabs:

    ### Looking for FAIR principles

    - Findable 
    - Accessible
    - Interoperable
    - Reusable

    ---


    ## Access

    - How easy was it to gain access to the materials?

    ## Installation

    - How easy / automated was installation?
    - Did you have any problems?

    ---

    ## Data
    - Were data clearly separated from code and other items?
    - Were large data files deposited in a trustworthy data repository and referred to using a persistent identifier?
    - Were data documented ...somehow...

    ---


    ## Documentation

    Was there adequate documentation describing:
    - how to install necessary software including non-standard dependencies?
    - how to use materials to reproduce the paper?
    - how to cite the materials, ideally in a form that can be copy and pasted?

    ---

    ## Analysis

    - Were you able to fully reproduce the paper? :white_check_mark:
    - How automated was the process of reproducing the paper?
    - How easy was it to link analysis code to:
    - the plots it generates
    - sections in the manuscript in which it is described

    ---

    ## Analysis

    ### If the analysis was not fully reproducible :no_entry_sign:
    - Did results (e.g. model outputs, tables, figures) differ to those published? By how much?
    - Were missing dependencies?
    - Was the computational environment not adequately described / captured?

    ---

    ## Review as a user :video_game:

    <br>

    #### What did you find easy / intuitive?



    #### What did you find confusing / difficult



    #### What did you enjoy?

    #### Give feedback in good faith

    #### Focus on community benefits and system level solutions

    # Additional activities

    ---

    ## Finished early?

    ### Explore the work more deeply:
    - Try and run additional analyses.
    - Create new plots. 
    - Combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!

    ---

    # Let's go! :checkered_flag:

    ---

    ## 1. Paper review / Team formation 

    + Have a look at the papers available for reproduction
    + Add your details to the **hackpad**.
    + Fine to work individually or tackle a papers as group

    ---

    ## 2. Project registration

    + Register your team and paper on the **hackpad**
    + Register for an account on the Hub.
    + Feel free to work here or in break-out rooms.

    ---

    ## 3. Reproduce Paper

    - Inspect the review form.
    - Try to reproduce the paper using the materials provided.
    - Record your responses to review questions according to your experiences.

    ---

    ## 4. Mid-point regroup

    - Which paper have you selected? Briefly describe what it's about.
    - Briefly describe the approach to reproducibility the paper has taken.
    - Anything in particular you like about the paper's approach so far?
    - Anything you're having difficulty with?

    ---

    ## 5. Feedback to authors

    - **Please complete the feedback form for authors**
    - Feel free to record general findings the hackpad

    ---

    ## 6. Final regroup

    - So, how did you get on? 
    - Final comments.
    - If there's time, tackle some discussion topics (see hackpad).
    - On post-its: One thing you liked, one thing that can be improved.
