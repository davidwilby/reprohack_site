> **As all ReproHack events, we strive to make this event open and inclusive
to all. As such the event is governed by the [ReproHack Code of
Conduct](code-of-conduct.html)
and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are
expected to uphold this code.**


We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to **make their
papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**.

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of
the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience
for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It’s imperative to note that **ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to
criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial
scientific activity in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and
valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research
community as a whole.

-----

## **Two ways to get involved:**

### **[Nominate a paper](https://link-to-submissionform)**

We invite nominations for papers that have both associated **code** and
**data** publicly available. We also encourage analyses based on open
source tools as we cannot guarantee participants will have access to
specialised licenced software.

[**Current list of proposed papers and
projects**](https://youraccount.shinyapps.io/reprohack-awesome-conf)

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about
**reproducibility**, working with **other people’s code and data** and
more\!

## **On the day**

If provided, use the event to track of discussions and take collaborative notes on the
event [**hackpad**](https://hackmd.io/link-to-copy-of-hackpad/edit)


## Tips for Reviewing


### Overall ReproHack Objectives

1. **Practical Experience in Reproducibility**

3. **Giving feedback to Authors**

5. **Thinking more broadly about opportunities and challenges associated with Research Reprodicibility**

### Special considerations when Reviewing

In addition to the **[ReproHack Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html)** 



### Additional Considerations

- #### Submitting authors are incredibly brave!

### Thank you Authors!

- #### Without them there would be no ReproHack.
- #### Show gratitude and appreciation for their efforts. `r emo::ji("pray")` 
- #### Constructive criticism only please!
