### 1: Your Team

#### Options:

Codecheck each others work (before submission or before sharing code online) 

Codecheck benchmarks (and share the frustration)

#### Upside: 

- Immediate use for your own research

- Use existing facilities

- Could be done before submission

#### Challenges:
Convincing colleagues can be difficult



---

## 2: Your classroom

#### Options:

- Coursework or hand-in assignments
- Peer reviews amongst students
- Assignments submitted binder ready

#### Challenges
More work beforehand, focus might shift from content to skill

#### Upside 
- Reproducible assignments are easier to handle
- Teaching important research skills along with content


**Join the discussion:** #TeachingByReprohacking on Twitter and the dedicated Teaching Channel on our Slack

- Special efforts for networking necessary


---

## 6: #ReproHack at a (un -) conference! 

#### Upside
- Part of a large event 
- “walk-in” participants
- within field/ specialty

#### Challenges:

- may need to be presented in submission process


---

## 7: Mix-and-Match

#### Options:
- Keep it to one programming language and interdisciplinary

- Cluster around one research topic across domains

- be creative and make this format your own!
