### 1: Your Team

Options:

Codecheck each others work (before submission or before sharing code online) 

Codecheck benchmarks (and share the frustration)

Upside: 
Immediate use
Use existing facilities
Could be done before submission

Challenges:
Convincing colleagues can be difficult



---

## 2: Your classroom

Options:

- Coursework or hand-in assignments
- Peer reviews amongst students
- Assignments submitted binder ready

Challenges
Lots of work beforehand (is it more though?)

Upside 
Reproducible assignments are easier to handle
Teaching important research skills along with content


**Join the discussion:** #TeachingByReprohacking and the dedicated Teaching Channel on our Slack

## 3: Your institute or faculty

Upsides: 	
Stay in one domain (more or less broadly)

Similar data (size, privacy issues etc) 

Similar scripting and programming languages

Get to know network with peers outside your lab


Challenges:
	Requires a bigger organizing team




---

## 4: Your university

Upsides: 

Interdisciplinary fun!

Share with people with similar enthusiasm!

Meet people that are in different communities (E.g. ReproducibiliTea)

Challenges: 
organize location, finance
communication across disciplines 
different levels of skills (Stats, Programming, Open Science things)



---

## 5: Remote #ReproHack 

Upside: 

Accessibility
	Expand to international community members

Challenges: 

Tech - can be expensive
Tech - can fail
Special efforts for networking necessary


---

## 6: #ReproHack at a (un -) conference! 

Upside

Part of a large event 
“walk-in” participants
	Within field/ specialty

Challenges:

Requires additional preparation, may need to be presented in submission process


---

## 7: Mix-and-Match

Options:
Keep it to one programming language and interdisciplinary

Cluster around one research topic across domains
