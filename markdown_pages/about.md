### ReproHack History

They were originally run as part of Opencon satellite events (Berlin
2016, London 2017) and inspired by Owen Petcheyâ€™s Reproducible Research course where
students attempt to recreate published results from raw data, over a few
months and multiple sessions.

We only had one day so set the challenge to be, to **reproduce
paper results from published data AND code**.

After a short hiatus and as calls for reproducibility increased, the
project was resurrected as part was resurrected as part of Anna
Krystalli's 2019 Software Sustainability Institute Fellows cohort which
supported the running of a series of ReproHacks
