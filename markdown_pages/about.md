# ReproHack History

### ReproHacks at OpenCon satellite events

ReproHacks started out as part of [OpenCon satellite events](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/opencon-london/) (Berlin
2016, London 2017) and inspired by Owen Petchey's [Reproducible Research in Ecology, Evolution, Behaviour, and Environmental Studies](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES) course, where
students attempt to recreate published results from raw data, over a few
months and multiple sessions.

We only had one day for our ReproHacks though, so we set the challenge to be, to **reproduce
a paper from published data AND code**.

### Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship

After a short hiatus and as calls for reproducibility increased, the
project was resurrected as part of Anna Krystalli's [2019 Software Sustainability Institute Fellows cohort](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2019-04-11-announcing-2019-software-sustainability-institute-fellows) which supported the running of a series of ReproHacks, beginning with a session at the [Carpentry Connect Manchester](https://software.ac.uk/blog/2019-08-07-reprohacking-carpentryconnect-manchester-2019).

### Leiden ReproHack

In the meantime, interest in running such events was picking up with the most comprehensive effort to date being made by a group of RLadies in the Netherlands around a [flagship ReproHack at Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/agenda/2019/11/reprohack-nl). The group had full support of their institution and with much enthusiasm managed to run a highly successful event that garnered the biggest crowd at a ReproHack to date!

### ReproHack Team formation


The succesful Leiden event also lead to the **formation of the core team around the project** with the aim of providing support and developing infrastructure to support others in running their own ReproHacks.

### Leiden ReproHack wins the Open Initiatives Trophy at Open Science Festival NL!

In February 2021, the Leiden ReproHack event went on to win the [Open Initiatives Trophy at Open Science Festival NL!](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/open-science-community-leiden/news/reprohack-award).

### ReproHack Hub Launch

If you are reading this, it means we've **hit our biggest milestone yet, the development and launch of the ReproHack hub!** We've designed it as a place where the community can coordinate all ReproHack activities! From here, authors will be able to submit papers for review at any time, organisers will be able to register their events though a simple form and partcipants will be able to submit their reviews! 

We hope this will facilitate and help normalise the activity of research code reviewing to the point where one day, it will be so embedded in research culture that we will be obsolete! Until then though, please use the hub to organise events, submit papers and submit your reviews! For any feedback on the hub as well as bug reports, feel free to use our [issue](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack_site/issues) tracker on GitHub or get in touch with us via [slack](https://reprohack-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/).

    In early 2020, the project received support from the <a href="https://n8cir.org.uk/news/reprohacks/"> N8 Centre of Excellence in Computationally Intensive Research (N8 CIR)</a> to run a  <a href="https://n8cir.org.uk/"> <strong>series of ReproHacks across 5 of N8 partner Universities throughout the North of England </strong> </a>.

    This was a great opportunity to introduce the ReproHack practice to participants across institutions and build interest around the project. Sadly, however, the start of the  COVID19 pandemic meant the Manchester event had to be abruptly cancelled.
