# Reprohack website

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## Overview

The Reprohack app is built using django webapp framework.

## Development and testing
The following are instructions for running the app on your local machine for testing or development.


### Dependencies

The project uses a combination of python and javascript libraries. [pip](https://pypi.org/) can be used to install all python related 
packages and [node/npm](https://nodejs.org) can be used to install javascript packages.

### Installation (using conda)
Use of conda is recommended as it is able to install all dependencies including nodejs. [A minimal version of 
conda can be obtained from here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Once `conda` is installed, the installation steps are as follows:

```
# Create a conda environment called 'reprohack'
conda create -n reprohack python=3.8

# Activate environment
source activate reprohack

# Install nodejs from conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs

# Install python dependencies
pip install -r requirements/local.txt

# Install node dependencies
```

### Configuration (`secret.py`): IMPORTANT!

You must create a 'secret' python settings file for storing information that should not be public at:

```
config/settings/secret.py
```

The default values of these settings are located at `config/settings/secret_default.py`.


### Running the development server





### Admin panel

The admin panel can be used 


### Setting up your users
* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll 
  see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. 
  Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command 
  ```bash
  $ python manage.py createsuperuser
  ``

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on 
Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.


### Testing

#### Running tests with py.test

Run the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

#### Type checks
**Is this useful?**
Running type checks with mypy:

```bash
mypy reprohack_hub
```

#### Test coverage
**Is this useful?**
To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
open htmlcov/index.html
```


## Deployment: Pythonanywhere
The following are steps for deploying on python anywhere.

* App setting is located at `config/settings/pythonanywhere.py`

### Configuration (`secret.py`): IMPORTANT!

You must create a 'secret' python settings file for storing information that should not be public at:

```
config/settings/secret.py
```

The default values of these settings are located at `config/settings/secret_default.py`.

### Installation: Python anywhere

**Instructions for installing a FRESH copy of the app on pythonanywhere.**

Python anywhere already comes with `Python 3.8` installed, so we can use virtualenv instead. Installation of node
on the server is not as javascript dependencies are copied to django's static folder and is tracked through version 
control.

After logging into pythonanywhere console or ssh into pythonanywhere: 

```bash
# Make sure we're in the home folder
cd ~

# Clone the app from the repository
git pull https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack_site.git

# Go into the folder
cd reprohack_site

# Create a virtual python environment using python 3.8
python -m virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.8  .virtualenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .virtualenv/bin/activate

# Install python dependencies
pip install requirements/production.txt
```

You will then need to create a secrets setting file at `config/settings/secret.py`, copy the 
contents of `config/settings/secret_default.py` and use that as the basis.

A mysql database can be set up through the pythonanywhere gui. Add the settings such as `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD` etc. 
to the `secret.py`.



Once all the above has been set up, we then need to build a 
```
# Build the database (
./manage.py migrate

# Collect the static assets into /staticfiles folder
./manage.py collectstatic
```

### WSGI file for the webapp

```python
import os
import sys

# add your project directory to the sys.path
project_home = '/home/reprohacks/reprohack_site'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)

# set environment variable to tell django where your settings.py is
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'config.settings.pythonanywhere'


# serve django via WSGI
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
```



## Host Your Own

Note: When hosting the page on the internet, you will need to add the `hostname` to the Django settings.
Edit `mysite/settings.py` by adding the `hostname`  to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list.
