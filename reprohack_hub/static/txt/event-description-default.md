We are all excited by the progress made by authors in **making their
papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**.

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience
for those who attempt to reproduce the work.

It’s important to highlight that **our events are by no means an attempt to criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial scientific activity in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and
valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research
community as a whole. 

By joining our event, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)

-----

## **Two ways to get involved:**

### Nominate a paper

We invite nominations for papers that have both associated **code** and
**data** publicly available. We also encourage analyses based on open
source tools as we cannot guarantee participants will have access to
specialised licenced software. 

See **list below for paper associated with this event** or browse the [full list of submitted papers](/paper/). You can also consult our [author guidelines](/author_guidelines) for more information.

### Review and reproduce a paper

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about
**reproducibility**, working with **other people’s code and data** and
more!

## **On the day**

We’ll track of discussions and collaborative notes on the
event **hackpad**

As all ReproHack events, **we strive to make this event open and inclusive
to all**. As such the event is governed by the [ReproHack Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).Please read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

### **Authors**

We encourage authors that are keen and submitting to a specific event, to engage with the event, even just to say hello! You can do so on twitter (check for event specific hashtags or use `@ReproHack`) or by
joining the **`review-chat`** channel in our
[**slack**](https://reprohack-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/) group. We’ve
also set up an **`authors`** channel in our
[**slack**](https://reprohack-autoinvite.herokuapp.com/) group as a
place where you can reach the organisers prior to the hack.

### **Participants**

#### **Introduction & Welcome** 

#### **1. Project review and team formation**

We’ll start with a brief review of the **available papers** and then form into teams. Feel free to work on your own if you prefer but we highly recommend you discuss your experiences with fellow participants as you work.

#### **2. Select and register a paper**

  - Add your details in the **participants** section of the
    **hackpad** so we have a complete list of participants (e.g name, affiliation, social links, pronouns etc).

  - In your teams, (or individually if you prefer) **decide which paper** you wish to work on.

  - **Register your team and paper** by logging the title of the
    selected paper and the name(s) of the reviewer(s) in the
    **hackpad**. You
    can use the following template:
    
        ### **Paper:** <Title of the paper reproduced>
        **Reviewers:** Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2 etc.

#### **3. Work on your paper!**

Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try
and reproduce the work. As you work through your paper, keep in mind the
main points on which feedback to the authors will provided, **Access**,
**Reproducibility**, **Documentation** and **Reusability** (see our [participant guidelines](/participant_guidelines) for more information). It might
help to have a look at the **Review form** before you begin and keep notes during your review. Feel free to use the event hackpad to record general findings you wish to share with the group.

We’ll **come together during the day** to discuss progress and
troubleshoot any sticking points.

Should you finish reproducing your paper quickly, feel free to explore
the work more deeply. For example, you could try and run additional
analyses, create new plots or even combine materials with your own or
other open materials available on the web!

Should you produce any additional materials relating to your
reproduction during the session (e.g. a markdown report, jupyter notebook, issue or pull requets in authors repository), feel free to **share it publicly**
and **add any links to such materials to the hackpad**.

#### **4. Complete your Review with feedback for the authors**

The most important part of the day is recording our experiences as feedback to the authors. Please make sure to complete a ** Review feedback form** for the paper you've selected, ideally, by the end of the day. Please also remember to be kind
and constructive. Reproducibilty is hard and all authors submitting
their papers have been incredibly brave. Feel free to browse any public feedback submissions to get inspiration. 

#### **5. Feedback to the group on your experiences**

You can use the hackpad to take notes and summarise your experiences.

#### **6. Closing Remarks**

-----

#### Collaborative note taking:

Feel free to contribute any additional thoughts on our collaborative
**hackpad**. These can help form the basis for a blogpost on the
event.
